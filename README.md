# Anon-Chat-Clients
Here are all clients for [Anon-Chat-Server](https://github.com/Braslerl/Anon-Chat-Server).
**Feel free to submit your own client, I'll test and link your repo.**
All the clients use this server: [http://public-chat-api.glitch.me/](http://public-chat-api.glitch.me/)
Hosted on glitch, maybe it need a time until it "wakes up" again. (;
